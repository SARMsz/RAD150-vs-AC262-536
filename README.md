<h2>What Are They?</h2>

<h3>RAD150 (TLB-150)</h3>
<p>RAD150 is an esterified version of RAD-140 (Testolone). That means it has a longer half-life and stays active in your system longer. It’s more stable and gives more sustained effects compared to standard RAD-140. It’s known for its anabolic strength, size gains, and energy boost.</p>

<h3>AC262,536 (Accadrine)</h3>
<p>AC262,536 is a newer and lighter SARM. It’s very selective — more so than older compounds — which means it targets muscle tissue while leaving other organs like the prostate alone. That’s a big win if you care about side effects. It’s less suppressive and feels smoother overall.</p>

<h2>How I Tested RAD150 vs AC262,536</h2>

<p>I used each compound for 6 weeks solo. No stacking, no other SARMs or enhancers, just clean cycles to feel the real effect. I trained 5 days a week, tracked my weight, strength, mood, sleep, libido, and recovery.</p>

<p>RAD150: 20mg/day<br>
AC262,536: 30mg/day</p>

<h2>My RAD150 Results</h2>

<p>RAD150 hits hard — and fast. By the end of week 1, I felt a massive strength boost. My pumps in the gym were insane, and I had crazy endurance on big lifts. By week 3, I was up 7 lbs — solid mass. My bench jumped 25 lbs. Shoulders looked rounder and more defined.</p>

<p>The downside? Suppression hit me around week 5. Libido dropped a bit, and I started feeling more tired. I expected this — RAD150 is strong and you will need a PCT.</p>

<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Bulking, strength, fast muscle gain</p>

<p><strong>Dose used:</strong> 20mg/day</p>

<h2>My AC262,536 Results</h2>

<p>AC262,536 took longer to kick in — about 2-3 weeks. But once it did, it gave a clean, dry, and lean feel. I only gained about 3-4 lbs, but it was all lean muscle. No bloat, no crash, and I looked more vascular.</p>

<p>I didn’t feel suppressed at all. Libido, energy, sleep — all stayed normal. I didn’t even run PCT after, and bloods were fine. It’s not as powerful as RAD150, but it’s safer and easier to run.</p>

<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Cutting, recomposition, first cycles</p>

<p><strong>Dose used:</strong> 30mg/day</p>
